[Nullmail](https://nullmail.cc) is now live! 

Nullmail is an open-source, privacy-focused, ephemeral tempmail service built with SvelteKit, Supabase, and ForwardEmail, hosted on Vercel. It provides instant, disposable inboxes with automatic expiry, no sign-up, and no tracking. Ideal for quick, anonymous email verification and sign-up flows.
