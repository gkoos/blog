Back in August I introduced [Nullmail](https://nullmail.cc) - a simple, privacy-first disposable email service. The idea was straightforward: generate a temporary address, receive mail for a short time, and move on without giving up your real email.

Since then, I've been working on making it more convenient to use. Having to open the website every time works fine, but sometimes you just want something faster. So I created browser extensions for Chrome and Firefox to streamline the process and they are finally approved and live in their respective stores:

- [Chrome Web Store]( https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/nullmail-extension/ogbnjlpdlihcbfmdffhkklhikjlmkfnm)
- [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/nullmail-extension/)

These extensions offer:
- One-click generation – get a fresh address straight from your browser toolbar.
- Manage temporary mailboxes from the extension popup.
- Same philosophy – no tracking, no accounts, same open-source backend.

The extension code is open-source and can be found in the same repository as the main site:
