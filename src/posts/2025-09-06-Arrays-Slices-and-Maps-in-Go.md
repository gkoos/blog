My first article as a freeCodeCamp News author just got published:

[Arrays, Slices, and Maps in Go: a Quick Guide to Collection Types](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/arrays-slices-and-maps-in-go-a-quick-guide-to-collection-types/)

The article is a quick, practical guide to Go's collection types: arrays, slices, and maps.

This is the first of several Go-focused beginners' guides I'm planning on writing for freeCodeCamp News.
