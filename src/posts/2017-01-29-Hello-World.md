OK, so this is the first entry here. Now normally you should define the goals and aims of the blog here but honestly, these days when developer blogs breed like rabbits and multiply like vermin, who cares?

The idea is to post articles, ideas, workarounds, hacks to problems that might pop up in my everyday work. It might prove useful not only for me but for anyone facing the same issues. So hello everyone, welcome to my blog!
