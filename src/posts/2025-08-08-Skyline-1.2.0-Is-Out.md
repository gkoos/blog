Version 1.2.0 of the [Skyline library](https://github.com/gkoos/skyline) is now available! 

This release implements partial skyline queries, allowing you to exclude dimensions from the skyline calculation. Apart from decreasing the amount of work needed to transform the data into a suitable format, this also enables you to give unique identifiers to the points in the skyline.
