For my blog posts, I often need to create diagrams and flowcharts. I like using Mermaid](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/) for this, but I just couldn't find a free online tool without limitations, so I built one myself. No signup, no ads, no limit on usage. It's a very simple tool that I might improve over time.
