I've moved my JavaScript fetch tools - `ffetch`, `chaos-proxy`, and the upcoming `chaos-fetch` - into a new GitHub organization: [fetch-kit](https://github.com/fetch-kit).

This change makes it easier to explore the full ecosystem of production-ready fetch utilities and testing tools in one place.

- Old links to individual repos (e.g., [gkoos/ffetch](https://github.com/gkoos/ffetch)) still work, GitHub automatically redirects them.
- All related tools are now centralized, making it easier to discover and use them together.
- Future tutorials, demos, and updates will reference the fetch-kit organization.
