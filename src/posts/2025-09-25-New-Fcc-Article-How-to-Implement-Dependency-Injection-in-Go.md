## New Article: How to Implement Dependency Injection in Go

My 3rd FreeCodeCamp article is live!  

In this article, I dive into dependency injection in Go: why it matters, how to implement it, and practical examples for writing cleaner, more testable code.  

Read it here: [How to Implement Dependency Injection in Go](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-use-dependency-injection-in-go/)
