My second article as a freeCodeCamp News author is now live:

[How to Work with Collections in Go Using the Standard Library Helpers](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-work-with-collections-in-go-using-the-standard-library-helpers/)

This article is a continuation of my first guide and focuses on practical ways to work with collections in Go using the standard library. It covers useful helpers for slices and maps and shows how to manipulate collections effectively without adding extra dependencies or reinventing the wheel.

The first article can be found here: [Arrays, Slices, and Maps in Go: a Quick Guide to Collection Types](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/arrays-slices-and-maps-in-go-a-quick-guide-to-collection-types/)

This is the second part of my beginner-friendly Go series for freeCodeCamp News.
